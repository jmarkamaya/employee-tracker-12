# SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker
##  My motivation was to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.
## I built this project so that A business owner can be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company.
## It helps the business owner with organizinv and planning their business
## I learned how to create a database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
## The easy to use command line makes my project stand out
